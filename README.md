# MemoryMesh 🧠

**AI-Powered Cognitive Co-Pilot for Alzheimer's Care**

MemoryMesh transforms how we care for Alzheimer's patients by providing proactive, empathetic, real-time assistance that prevents crises before they happen. Unlike reactive solutions like GPS trackers or door alarms, MemoryMesh uses continuous AI-powered vision analysis to understand the patient's environment and context in real-time, then speaks directly to them through Google Home Mini with warm, conversational guidance.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Intelligent Decision-Making**: Sophisticated intervention hierarchy (90% AI-only, 8% notify, 2% emergency)

### Personalized Care
- **Patient Profiles**: Detailed profiles with memories, preferences, family information
- **Therapeutic Techniques**: Validation therapy, reminiscence therapy, gentle redirection
- **Continuous Learning**: AI improves intervention strategies based on what works for each patient

### Caregiver Dashboard

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- Python 3.8+ and pip
- Claude API key (Anthropic)
- OpenAI API key (for Sora-2 video generation)
- Creao vision API access

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd MindMesh
```

2. Install backend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cd ..
```

4. Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example backend/.env
# Edit backend/.env with your API keys
```

Required API keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - For Sora-2 video generation
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - For Claude AI
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` - For voice synthesis
- `CREAO_API_KEY` - For vision analysis

### Generate Demo Videos (One-Time Setup)

MemoryMesh uses pre-generated AI videos instead of live webcam feeds for demos:

```bash
# Quick setup (interactive)
./setup_videos.sh

# Or manual generation
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
python video/generate_persona_videos.py
```

This generates 8 videos (4 scenarios × 2 personas):
- **Duration**: 24 seconds each
- **Resolution**: 1080p
- **Cost**: ~$40-80 one-time
- **Location**: `assets/videos/`

Videos are cached and reused for all future demos.

See [VIDEO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md](VIDEO_GENERATION_GUIDE.md) for details.

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm run server
```

The server will start on http://localhost:5000

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend:
```bash
npm run client
```

The dashboard will open at http://localhost:3000

3. Or run both concurrently:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Demo Scenarios

The application includes four powerful demo scenarios accessible from the dashboard:

### 1. Meal Confusion
**Scenario**: Patient repeatedly opens refrigerator, confused about whether they ate lunch

**AI Response**:
- Shows timestamped photos of recent meal
- Validates feelings without harsh correction
- Redirects to pleasant activity (family photos, bird watching)
- Example: "Hi Margaret, I see you're looking for something to eat. You know what? You just had a wonderful chicken soup lunch 30 minutes ago. How about we look at photos of Emma's soccer game instead?"

### 2. Stove Safety (Critical)
**Scenario**: Burner on with no pot - immediate safety hazard

**AI Response**:
- Immediate calm engagement (doesn't alarm patient)
- Automatic stove shutoff via smart home
- Gentle redirection to safe activity
- Emergency notification to caregiver if needed
- Example: "Hi Margaret, I see you're at the stove. What would you like to cook? Actually, how about we watch the birds at the feeder instead? I'll put on some Frank Sinatra."

### 3. Wandering
**Scenario**: Patient near door, attempting to leave

**AI Response**:
- Validation without restriction
- Reminiscence therapy to ground them
- Engaging indoor activity suggestion
- Example: "Margaret, would you like to go somewhere? Let me show you these beautiful photos from your Hawaii trip with Robert first."

### 4. Agitation
**Scenario**: Patient showing signs of distress

**AI Response**:
- Calming music (patient's favorites)
- Comforting family photos
- Soothing environment creation
- Example: "Margaret, let's listen to 'Fly Me to the Moon' together and look at these lovely photos of your grandchildren."

Shifts attention from problematic fixations to positive stimuli.

### Routine Reinforcement
Reduces confusion through consistency and familiar patterns.

### Sensory Engagement
Music triggers deep emotional memories; visual cues ground in reality.
