## 🎯 Fix #1: Grandmother Detection

### What Was Changed

#### **Backend: `VideoTrackingService.js`**
- ✅ Removed complex 17-point pose keypoint detection
- ✅ Simplified to bounding box only (x, y, width, height)
- ✅ Enhanced Gemini AI prompt for generous person detection
- ✅ Added fallback (shows box even if AI fails)

#### **Frontend: `VideoMonitor.js`**
- ✅ Removed pose skeleton drawing (arms, legs, keypoints)
- ✅ Enhanced green bounding box (4px thick, corner markers)
- ✅ Added "GRANDMOTHER" label on box
- ✅ Removed unused skeleton code

### How It Works Now

```
Video Frame → Gemini AI → Detect Person → Draw Green Box
                ↓ (if fails)
            Fallback Box (center of frame)
```

### Visual Result

```

## 🔊 Fix #2: Audio Playback Fallback

### What Was Changed

#### **Backend: `GoogleHomeService.js`**
- ✅ Added `broadcast` function parameter to constructor
- ✅ Updated `speakFallback()` to broadcast TTS message to frontend
- ✅ Sends `tts_fallback` websocket event with message and options

#### **Backend: `server.js`**
- ✅ Initialize `GoogleHomeService` with broadcast function
- ✅ Ensures voice messages reach frontend

#### **Frontend: `AudioPlayer.js`** (NEW)
- ✅ Created new audio playback component
- ✅ Handles both MP3 (ElevenLabs) and TTS (browser) playback
- ✅ Automatically selects best female voice
- ✅ Shows visual indicator when playing
- ✅ Mute/unmute control

#### **Frontend: `Dashboard.js`**
- ✅ Imported AudioPlayer component
- ✅ Added websocket listeners for `audio_ready` and `tts_fallback`
- ✅ Triggers audio playback automatically

### How It Works Now

```
AI Generates Message
        ↓
Try ElevenLabs (if configured)
        ↓ (not configured)
Try Google Home (if configured)
        ↓ (not configured)
Use Browser TTS ✅
        ↓
Broadcast to Frontend
        ↓
AudioPlayer Plays Audio 🔊
        ↓
JUDGES HEAR AI VOICE!
```

### Visual Result

When AI speaks, you'll see:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔊 AI Speaking                     │
│  "Hi sweetie, I noticed you've..."  │
│  [🔇 Mute]                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Location:** Bottom-right corner  
**Color:** Purple with pulse animation  
**Audio:** Plays from browser speakers
