# MemoryMesh - Recent Updates

## üéâ Major Improvements

### 1. ‚úÖ Real Webcam Integration
**Before**: Static placeholder saying "Camera feed will appear here"

**Changes**:
- Added `useWebcam` custom hook ([frontend/src/hooks/useWebcam.js](frontend/src/hooks/useWebcam.js))
- Updated `LiveMonitor` component to display actual camera feed
- Automatically requests camera permission on load
- Sends video frames to backend every 3 seconds for analysis
- Displays AI annotations overlay on live video

**How to use**:

3. AI analyzes frames in real-time
4. Annotations show location, activity, emotional state

### 2. ‚úÖ Rich, Unique Demo Responses
**Before**: Generic "scenario detected" with no personalized message
**Now**: Each scenario triggers unique, personalized AI responses

**Changes**:
- Added `DemoResponseService` ([backend/services/DemoResponseService.js](backend/services/DemoResponseService.js))
- Each scenario now has 3 variations of personalized responses
- Responses use patient-specific details (names, memories, preferences)
- Immediate response (no waiting for external API calls)

**Example Responses**:

**Meal Confusion**:
> "Hi Margaret, I see you're looking for something to eat. You know what? You just had a delicious chicken soup lunch 30 minutes ago. I have the photo right here with the time stamp. How about we look at those beautiful photos of Emma's soccer game instead? She scored a goal last week!"

**Stove Safety**:
> "Hi Margaret, I see you're at the stove. What would you like to cook today? Actually, you know what? The birds at the feeder are absolutely beautiful right now - cardinals and blue jays. How about we watch them together? I'll put on 'Fly Me to the Moon' for you. The kitchen can wait."

**Wandering**:
> "Margaret, would you like to go somewhere? That's a wonderful thought. Before we do, let me show you these beautiful photos from your trip to Hawaii with Robert. Remember that amazing sunset at Waikiki Beach? You both looked so happy. Come sit with me and we'll look at all the photos together."

**Agitation**:
> "Margaret, come sit with me for a moment. Let's listen to 'Fly Me to the Moon' together - I know how much you love this song. And look, I have these beautiful new photos of Emma and Lucas. They're growing up so wonderfully. Emma just won her soccer game! Isn't she talented, just like her grandmother?"

### 3. ‚úÖ Google Home Mini Integration
**Before**: Basic console logging only
**Now**: Full Google Home integration (with fallback)

**Changes**:
- Added `GoogleHomeService` ([backend/services/GoogleHomeService.js](backend/services/GoogleHomeService.js))
- Supports real Google Home devices on your network
- Graceful fallback to console/browser TTS if no device found
- Voice messages spoken aloud through Google Home or browser

**How to enable real Google Home**:
1. Find your Google Home's IP address (check your router)
2. Edit `backend/.env`:
   ```
   GOOGLE_HOME_IP=192.168.1.100
   GOOGLE_HOME_NAME=Living Room Speaker
   ```
3. Restart backend server
4. Voice messages will now play through your Google Home!

**What you'll see/hear**:
- Backend console shows: `üîä Speaking: [message]`
- Google Home speaks the personalized message
- Voice history tracked in dashboard

### 4. ‚úÖ Dynamic, Non-Hardcoded System
**Before**: Some hardcoded patient details
**Now**: Fully dynamic system using patient profile

**Changes**:
- All responses generated from `PatientProfile` data
- Patient names, family, preferences loaded dynamically
- Easy to customize for different patients
- No hard-coded text in responses

**To customize for a different patient**:
Edit [backend/models/PatientProfile.js](backend/models/PatientProfile.js):
```javascript
this.preferredName = 'Your Patient Name';
this.family = {
  spouse: { name: 'Spouse Name', ... },
  children: [...],
  grandchildren: [...]
};
this.preferences = {
  music: { favoriteArtists: [...] },
  ...
};
