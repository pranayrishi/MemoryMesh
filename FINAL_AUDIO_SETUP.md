# Final Audio Setup - Ready for Hackathon! 🎉

## ✅ All Changes Complete

### 1. Voice Timing: 24 Seconds ✅
- Voice now plays **24 seconds** after video starts
- Plays **after the AI video ends**
- Perfect timing for demo flow

### 2. ElevenLabs Professional Voice ✅
- **API Key:** Added to `.env`
- **Voice ID:** `yUy9CCX9brt8aPVvIWy3` (your custom voice)
- **Quality:** Professional, natural, elegant voice
- **Backend:** Restarted with new credentials

### 3. No Repeating ✅
- Voice plays **once per scenario**
- Duplicate detection active
- Clean, professional experience

## Current Configuration

### .env File
```bash
# ElevenLabs Voice Synthesis (Professional Quality)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=9c4d80f8ad36e6b48f8f802a3e31dc87639cb420e682fc716f8e7d8b5e3ddad9
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=yUy9CCX9brt8aPVvIWy3
```

### Timing
- **Video Duration:** ~20-22 seconds
- **Voice Delay:** 24 seconds
- **Result:** Voice plays right after video ends

## How It Works

```
Demo Triggered
     ↓
Video Plays (0-22s)
     ↓
Video Ends (~22s)
     ↓
Wait 2 more seconds
     ↓
Voice Plays (24s) 🔊
     ↓
Professional ElevenLabs Voice
     ↓
Plays Once Only
```

## Testing

### 1. Refresh Browser
```bash
# In browser:
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
```

### 2. Trigger Demo
1. Click **⚡ Demo** button
2. Select any scenario
3. Watch video play
4. **Wait 24 seconds**
5. Hear professional voice! 🎙️

### 3. Expected Behavior
- Video plays for ~22 seconds
- Brief pause
- Professional voice speaks at 24 seconds
- Voice plays once only
- No repeating

## Backend Logs to Verify

When demo triggers, you should see:

```
🎙️  Voice message to speak: Hi Margaret...
✅ Voice synthesized with ElevenLabs
📡 Broadcast audio_ready to 1 client(s)
```

**If you see this, ElevenLabs is working!**

## Browser Console Logs

```
🔊 Audio ready event received (ElevenLabs): {...}
[Wait 24 seconds]
🎙️  Playing ElevenLabs audio now...
```

## Voice Quality Comparison

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ❌ Robotic browser TTS | ✅ Professional ElevenLabs |
| ❌ Played at 18 seconds | ✅ Plays at 24 seconds |
| ❌ Repeated multiple times | ✅ Plays once only |
| ❌ During video | ✅ After video ends |

## Fallback Behavior

If ElevenLabs fails for any reason:
1. System automatically falls back to browser TTS
2. Still uses 24-second delay
3. Still plays once only
4. Demo continues smoothly

## Status Check

✅ **ElevenLabs API Key:** Configured  
✅ **Voice ID:** Set to your custom voice  
✅ **Timing:** 24 seconds (after video)  
✅ **Duplicate Prevention:** Active  
✅ **Backend:** Running with new config  
✅ **Frontend:** Updated with 24s delay  

## For Your Hackathon Demo

### Demo Flow:
1. **Introduce the system** (30 seconds)
2. **Click Demo button** (5 seconds)
3. **Video plays** - Point out AI detection (22 seconds)
4. **Voice speaks** - Highlight empathetic AI (10 seconds)
5. **Show intervention card** - Explain reasoning (20 seconds)

**Total:** ~90 seconds per scenario

### Tips:
- **Practice timing** - Know when voice will play
- **Volume up** - Make sure judges hear the voice
- **Multiple scenarios** - Show variety (meal confusion, stove safety, wandering)
- **Emphasize** - Professional voice quality, perfect timing, no repeats

## Troubleshooting

### No voice after 24 seconds?

**Check backend logs:**
```bash
# Should see:
✅ Voice synthesized with ElevenLabs
```

**If you see error:**
```bash
⚠️  ElevenLabs error: [error message]
```
Then check API key is correct in `.env`

### Voice sounds robotic?

**Means:** ElevenLabs not working, using browser TTS fallback

**Fix:** 
1. Check `.env` has correct API key
2. Restart backend: `lsof -ti:5000 | xargs kill -9 && node backend/server.js`
3. Check backend logs for ElevenLabs confirmation

### Voice repeats?

**Should not happen** - duplicate prevention is active

**If it does:**
1. Refresh browser
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check console for duplicate detection logs

## Files Changed

1. ✅ `frontend/src/components/SimpleTTS.js` - Changed delay to 24s
2. ✅ `frontend/src/App.js` - Changed ElevenLabs delay to 24s
3. ✅ `.env` - Added ElevenLabs credentials
4. ✅ `backend/server.js` - Restarted with new config

## Ready for Hackathon! 🚀

**Everything is configured and working:**
- Professional voice quality (ElevenLabs)
- Perfect timing (24 seconds, after video)
- No repeating (plays once only)
- Bulletproof fallback (browser TTS if needed)

**Just refresh your browser and test the demo!**

**Good luck with your hackathon!** 🎉

The audio system is now production-ready with professional voice quality, perfect timing, and reliable performance.
