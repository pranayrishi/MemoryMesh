# Video Tracking Issue - RESOLVED

## Problem Summary
The video tracking feature was returning a 404 error when trying to detect and track people (grandma) in AI-generated videos. The frontend was trying to POST to `/api/tracking/detect-frame`, but the endpoint wasn't responding.

### Error Messages
```
POST http://localhost:5000/api/tracking/detect-frame 404 (Not Found)
Cannot POST /api/tracking/detect-frame
```

## Root Cause
The tracking endpoint existed in the code but the server needed to be restarted. Additionally, there was a TensorFlow.js compatibility issue with the Node.js environment that prevented the COCO-SSD model from loading properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced TensorFlow with Gemini Vision API
Instead of using TensorFlow.js COCO-SSD (which had compatibility issues), the VideoTrackingService now uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash Vision API** for person detection and bounding box generation.

**Why Gemini?**
- Already integrated in the project
- More accurate for elderly person detection
- Provides semantic understanding ("what they're doing")
- No compatibility issues
- Returns bounding box coordinates directly

### 2. Updated VideoTrackingService.js
**Location:** `backend/services/VideoTrackingService.js`

**Key Changes:**
- Removed TensorFlow.js and COCO-SSD dependencies
- Implemented Gemini Vision API for frame analysis
- Gemini provides:
  - Person detection (true/false)
  - Bounding box coordinates (as percentages)
  - Confidence score
  - Activity description

**API Response Format:**
```json
{
  "person_detected": true,
  "bounding_box": {
    "x": 25.5,
    "y": 15.0,
    "width": 40.0,
    "height": 70.0
  },
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "activity": "standing near refrigerator"
}
```

### 3. Server Restart
Restarted the backend server to register the tracking endpoint and load the new Gemini-based service.

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend (VideoMonitor.js):**
   - Captures video frames every 1 second
   - Converts frame to base64 JPEG
   - Sends to `/api/tracking/detect-frame`

2. **Backend (VideoTrackingService.js):**
   - Receives base64 frame data
   - Sends to Gemini Vision API
   - Gemini analyzes frame and returns bounding box
   - Results are cached to avoid redundant API calls

3. **Frontend Display:**
   - Green bounding box drawn on canvas overlay
   - Box follows person as they move
   - Corner markers for better visibility
   - Label shows "TRACKING"

## Files Modified

1. **backend/services/VideoTrackingService.js** - Complete rewrite to use Gemini
2. **backend/server.js** - Already had endpoint at line 735-743

## Testing

The endpoint is now working. Test with:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/tracking/detect-frame \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"frameData": "...", "videoId": "test", "frameNumber": 1}'
```

## Next Steps to Use

1. **Ensure server is running:**
   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

2. **Start frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

3. **Trigger a video scenario:**
   - Click the lightning bolt (⚡) button
   - Select a scenario (meal_confusion, stove_safety, wandering)
   - Video will play with green tracking box around grandma

## Performance Optimizations

- **Caching:** Results cached per frame to avoid duplicate API calls
- **Rate limiting:** 1 frame per second (adjustable in VideoMonitor.js line 136)
- **Percentage coordinates:** Bounding box scales with video player size

## API Usage

**Gemini API calls:** ~1 per second during video playback
**Cost:** Minimal (Gemini 2.0 Flash is optimized for speed/cost)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smoothing:** Implement frame interpolation to reduce box jitter
2. **Pre-generation:** Generate tracking data when videos are created
3. **Multiple people:** Detect and track multiple persons
4. **Pose estimation:** Use Gemini to detect specific poses/activities

## Status: ✅ RESOLVED

The video tracking feature is now fully functional using Gemini Vision API. The green bounding box will track grandma as she moves through the video frames.
